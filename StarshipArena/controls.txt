=====HOW TO PLAY=====
Systems Afire is a 2D space-based RTS written in Java using the LWJGL game library.


Objective: In each level, the player controls the blue faction while an enemy AI controls the red faction.
           The player must destroy all of the enemy's ships and take over all of the enemy's planets to win.




*****STRATEGY*****:
There are three ship types in the game:
 1: Fighters. These are the basic combat starship. Costing 5 resources, they have 20 armor and are mounted with a medium-damage plasma cannon.
    They move fairly slowly and are not very manueverable, but en masse they will melt anything in their path.
     - Counters: Interceptor
     - Countered by: Battleship
 2: Interceptors. These are advanced starships designed for quick and effective penetration into enemy territory. Costing 20 resources, they have 30 armor
    and are mounted with not only a plasma cannon but also two high-damage machine guns. They are quick and agile and are great for raiding
    and ambushing troops.
     - Counters: Battleship
     - Countered by: Fighter
 3: Battleships. These are heavy behemoths suited with long-range harrasment and defense. Costing 40 resources, they have 50 armor and are mounted with
    six medium-damage defensive machinegun turrets and one long-range missile launcher. Although they are slow and unwielding, their missiles will turn
    any ship into shrapnel with a direct hit.
     - Counters: Fighter
     - Countered by: Interceptor
A player should use these three ship types to build an effective army to conquer more planets. Planets provide resource production, so the player with more planets
will be able to build more ships and perform better in the long run.
