# StarshipArena
A space-based RTS written in Java for the Oregon Game Programming Challenge
We are still developing this game, even though the competition has already ended!

This repository contains source-code **and** an executable. Note, however, that the executable may occassionally be slightly behind the source-code. You can always run the executable, but to guarantee the latest version, compile the code yourself.
