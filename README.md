# StarshipArena
A space-based RTS written in Java for the Oregon Game Programming Challenge
We are still developing this game, even though the competition has already ended!

This repository holds source-code only and does not contain an executable file (exporting it is a buggy headache). Thus, you will need Eclipse IDE or similar (anything that's compatible with a Gradle build, I believe) to compile it before you can run it.
